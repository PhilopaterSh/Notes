### Examples of information disclosure
Some basic examples of information disclosure are as follows:
- Revealing the names of hidden directories, their structure, and their contents via a `robots.txt` file or directory listing
- Providing access to source code files via temporary backups
- Explicitly mentioning database table or column names in error messages
- Unnecessarily exposing highly sensitive information, such as credit card details
- Hard-coding API keys, IP addresses, database credentials, and so on in the source code
- Hinting at the existence or absence of resources, usernames, and so on via subtle differences in application behavior

- Information disclosure in error messages

- ### How to assess the severity of information disclosure vulnerabilities
	- It is important to exercise common sense when you find that potentially sensitive information is being leaked. It is likely that minor technical details can be discovered in numerous ways on many of the websites you test. Therefore, your main focus should be on the impact and exploitability of the leaked information, not just the presence of information disclosure as a standalone issue. The obvious exception to this is when the leaked information is so sensitive that it warrants attention in its own right.

	- ## How to test for information disclosure vulnerabilities
	  Generally speaking, it is important not to develop "tunnel vision" during testing. In other words, you should avoid focussing too narrowly on a particular vulnerability. Sensitive data can be leaked in all kinds of places, so it is important not to miss anything that could be useful later. You will often find sensitive data while testing for something else. A key skill is being able to recognize interesting information whenever and wherever you do come across it.

	- ### How to prevent information disclosure vulnerabilities
		Preventing information disclosure completely is tricky due to the huge variety of ways in which it can occur. However, there are some general best practices that you can follow to minimize the risk of these kinds of vulnerability creeping into your own websites.
		- Make sure that everyone involved in producing the website is fully aware of what information is considered sensitive. Sometimes seemingly harmless information can be much more useful to an attacker than people realize. Highlighting these dangers can help make sure that sensitive information is handled more securely in general by your organization.
		- Audit any code for potential information disclosure as part of your QA or build processes. It should be relatively easy to automate some of the associated tasks, such as stripping developer comments.
		- Use generic error messages as much as possible. Don't provide attackers with clues about application behavior unnecessarily.
		- Double-check that any debugging or diagnostic features are disabled in the production environment.
		- Make sure you fully understand the configuration settings, and security implications, of any third-party technology that you implement. Take the time to investigate and disable any features and settings that you don't actually need.

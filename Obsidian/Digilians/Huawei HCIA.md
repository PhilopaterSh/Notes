(A, C, D)

### Q4: Which statements are true about the OSI layers?
A:
	• 	Application layer: provides network services for applications and is closest to end users
	• 	Session layer: establishes, manages, and terminates sessions
	• 	Network layer: defines logical addresses and transmits data between networks
	• 	Transport layer: supports connection-oriented and connectionless transmission, error detection, and retransmission

### Q5: A MAC address is 48 bits (6 bytes) in length and consists of 12 hexadecimal digits.
A: Right

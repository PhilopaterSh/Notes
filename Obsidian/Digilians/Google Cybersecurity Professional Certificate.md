### Module 1 Welcome to the exciting world of cybersecurity
**Cybersecurity (or security)**
The practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation

**Threat actor**
Any person or group who presents a security risk

> One of the things that I had to figure out very early in this journey is what kind of learner I was.


> Most of cybersecurity work is going to be learned on the job in the specific environment that you're protecting.

It's really easy to get imposter syndrome in cybersecurity because it's so broad and mastery of all these different areas is a lifetime's work.

**Security analysts** are responsible for monitoring and protecting information and systems.
	Analysts also often take part in exercises to search for weaknesses in an organization's own systems. For example, a security analyst may contribute to penetration testing or ethical hacking. The goal is to penetrate or hack their own organization's internal network to identify vulnerabilities and suggest ways to strengthen their security measures.
	Need to have intellectual curiosity and the motivation to keep learning in order to succeed.

 The difference between this **entry- level cybersecurity analyst** and an **entry-level cybersecurity engineer** is pretty much that the analyst is more focused on operations and the engineer, while they can do operations, they also build the, the detections and they do more project focused work.
#### Key takeaways:
Understanding key technical terms and concepts used in the security field will help prepare you for your role as a security analyst. Knowing these terms can help you identify common threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. To explore a variety of cybersecurity terms, visit the [National Institute of Standards and Technology glossary](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary). Or use your browser to search for high-quality, reliable cybersecurity glossaries from research institutes or governmental authorities. Glossaries are available in multiple languages.

What are the primary responsibilities of an entry-level security analyst?
	Monitor systems, protect information, and search for weaknesses.

security analysts need to have intellectual curiosity and the motivation to keep learning in order to succeed.

 Personally identifiable information, known as **(PII)** is any information used to infer an individual's identity. PII includes someone's full name, date of birth, physical address, phone number, email address, internet protocol, or IP address and similar information.
 Sensitive personally identifiable information, known as **(SPII)** is a specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines and may include social security numbers, medical or financial information, and biometric data, such as facial recognition.

### Module 2

In 1986, the Alvi brothers created the Brain virus,
Morris worm. In 1988, Robert Morris developed

 In the year 2000, Onel De Guzman created the LoveLetter malware to steal internet login credentials. This attack spread rapidly and took advantage of people who had not developed a healthy suspicion for unsolicited emails. Users received an email with the subject line, "I Love You." Each email contained an attachment labeled, "Love Letter For You." When the attachment was opened, the malware scanned a user's address book. Then, it automatically sent itself to each person on the list and installed a program to collect user information and passwords. Recipients would think they were receiving an email from a friend, but it was actually malware. The LoveLetter ended up infecting 45 million computers globally and is believed to have caused over $10 billion dollars in damages. The LoveLetter attack is the first example of social engineering.

Some of the most common types of social engineering attacks today include:
- **Watering hole attack:** A threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.
    
- **USB baiting:** A threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install, to unknowingly infect a network.

#### **Social engineering principles** 

Social engineering is incredibly effective. This is because people are generally trusting and conditioned to respect authority. The number of social engineering attacks is increasing with every new social media application that allows public access to people's data. Although sharing personal data—such as your location or photos—can be convenient, it’s also a risk.

Reasons why social engineering attacks are effective include:

- **Authority:** Threat actors impersonate individuals with power. This is because people, in general, have been conditioned to respect and follow authority figures. 
    
- **Intimidation:** Threat actors use bullying tactics. This includes persuading and intimidating victims into doing what they’re told. 
    
- **Consensus/Social proof:** Because people sometimes do things that they believe many others are doing, threat actors use others’ trust to pretend they are legitimate. For example, a threat actor might try to gain access to private data by telling an employee that other people at the company have given them access to that data in the past. 
    
- **Scarcity:** A tactic used to imply that goods or services are in limited supply. 
    
- **Familiarity:** Threat actors establish a fake emotional connection with users that can be exploited.  
    
- **Trust:** Threat actors establish an emotional relationship with users that can be exploited _over time_. They use this relationship to develop trust and gain personal information.
    
- **Urgency:** A threat actor persuades others to respond quickly and without questioning.


**Phishing** is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software. 

Some of the most common types of phishing attacks today include: 

- **Business Email Compromise (BEC):** A threat actor sends an email message that seems to be from a known source to make a seemingly legitimate request for information, in order to obtain a financial advantage.
    
- **Spear phishing:** A malicious email attack that targets a specific user or group of users. The email seems to originate from a trusted source.
    
- **Whaling:** A form of spear phishing. Threat actors target company executives to gain access to sensitive data.
    
- **Vishing:** The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.
    
- **Smishing:** The use of text messages to trick users, in order to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.
[Sean Terbeek | LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-terbeek/)

 **Password attack**
 - Brute force    
 - Rainbow table

 **Physical attack**
 - Malicious USB cable
- Malicious flash drive
- Card cloning and skimming

**Adversarial artificial intelligence** is a technique that manipulates [artificial intelligence and machine learning](https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/ai/adversarial-machine-learning) technology to conduct attacks more efficiently.
 
 **Supply-chain attack** targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed.

#####  As of 2022, CISSP has defined eight domains to organize the work of security professionals.
- **Security and risk management** focuses on defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and the law.
- **Asset security** This domain focuses on securing digital and physical assets.
- **Security architecture and engineering** This domain focuses on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place.
-  **Communication and network security** This domain focuses on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications.
- **Identity and access management** focuses on keeping data secure, by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage physical assets, like office spaces, and logical assets, such as networks and applications.
- **Security assessment and testing** This domain focuses on conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.
- **security operations** This domain focuses on conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures.
- **Software development security** This domain focuses on using secure coding practices, which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services.


To view detailed information and definitions of terms covered in this reading, visit the [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) glossary](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/nist). **Pro tip:** If you cannot find a term in the NIST glossary, enter the appropriate search term (e.g., “cybersecurity birthday attack”) into your preferred search engine to locate the definition in another reliable source such as a .edu or .gov site.


 Threat actor types
 - Advanced persistent threats (APTs) have significant expertise accessing an organization's network without authorization.
 - **Insider threats** abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization.
 - **Hacktivists** are threat actors that are driven by a political agenda.

### Module 3

**Security frameworks:**
Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy.
They have four core components:
1. Identifying and documenting security goals 
2. Setting guidelines to achieve security goals 
3. Implementing strong security processes
4. Monitoring and communicating results

**Compliance** is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations.

**Security controls:**
Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks.

The E.U.'s General Data Protection Regulation, also known as GDPR. GDPR is a data protection law established to grant European citizens more control over their personal data.

**CIA triad:**
A foundational model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies.

**Confidentiality:**
Only authorized users can access specific assets or data.

**Integrity:**
Data is correct, authentic, and reliable.

**Availability:**
Data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.

**Asset:**
An item perceived as having value to an organization.

**NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF):**
A voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk
	Examples of frameworks include the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).
	In addition to the [NIST CSF](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) and [NIST RMF](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/about-rmf), there are several other controls, frameworks, and compliance standards that are important for security professionals to be familiar with to help keep organizations and the people they serve safe.

Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP)

[Heather Adkins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/argvee/)  Vice President of Security Engineering at Google.

**Security ethics:**
Guidelines for making appropriate decisions as a security professional

A **vigilante** is a person who is not a member of law enforcement who decides to stop a crime on their own.

A **hacktivist** is a person who uses hacking to achieve a political goal.

To learn more about specific scenarios and ethical concerns from an international perspective, review updates provided in the [Tallinn Manual online](https://ccdcoe.org/research/tallinn-manual/ "Tallinn Manual").

#### Ethical principles and methodologies
- **Confidentiality** means that only authorized users can access specific assets or data.
- **Privacy protection** means safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use.
- **Laws** are rules that are recognized by a community and enforced by a governing entity.

**Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**

### Module 4

#### Tools for protecting business operations

- **Security information and event management (SIEM) tools**
	A **SIEM tool** is an application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization.
		Splunk and Chronicle
- A **log** is a record of events that occur within an organization’s systems.
- A **network protocol analyzer**, also known as a **packet sniffer**, is a tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic in a network.
- A **playbook** is a manual that provides details about any operational action, such as how to respond to a security incident.
- Dashboard A tool used to visually communicate information or data.

## Course  2.**Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks**
bout this Course

This course takes a deeper dive into concepts introduced in the first course, with an emphasis on recognizing the focus of the CISSP eight security domains, steps of risk management, security frameworks and controls (e.g., NIST, CIA triad, OWASP), as well as common security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. Additionally, learners are provided with an opportunity to explore and analyze SIEM data, use a playbook to respond to identified threats, risks, and vulnerabilities, and conduct a security audit. By the end of this course, you will: 
- Identify the common threats, risks, and vulnerabilities to business operations. 
- Understand the threats, risks, and vulnerabilities that entry-level cybersecurity analysts are most focused on. 
- Comprehend the purpose of security frameworks and controls. 
- Describe the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad. 
- Explain the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) framework. 
- Explore and practice conducting a security audit. 
- Use a playbook to respond to threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.

|Basic Info | Course 2 of 9 in the [Google Cybersecurity Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/google-cybersecurity) |
|Level | Beginner |
### Module 1

 For example, performing a secure design review during the design phase, secure code reviews during the development and testing phases, and penetration testing during the deployment and implementation phase ensures that security is embedded into the software product at every step.

- Information security, or InfoSec, is also related to this domain and refers to a set of processes established to secure information.
- InfoSec design processes, such as:
	- Incident response
	- Vulnerability management
	- Application security
	- Cloud security
	- Infrastructure security
- Security analysts may need to store, maintain, and retain data by creating backups to ensure they are able to restore the environment if a security incident places the organization’s data at risk.
- National Institute of Standards and Technology Risk Management Framework ([NIST RMF](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/about-rmf)) and Health Information Trust Alliance ([HITRUST](https://hitrustalliance.net/product-tool/hitrust-csf/?utm_term=&utm_campaign=HITRUST_i1_PaidSearch&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=2724012343&hsa_cam=16641331914&hsa_grp=136906352837&hsa_ad=598980848547&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=dsa-1659695676388&hsa_kw=&hsa_mt=&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQiAorKfBhC0ARIsAHDzsluRN5tSpCQal-rYnZLo2wUNppQdUHUba82LMX3JMGOoRPEJ6wG6-LgaAryYEALw_wcB)).
- A **threat** is any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.
- A **risk** is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset.
### Module 2
- There are many resources, such as the NIST, that provide lists of [cybersecurity risks](https://www.nist.gov/itl/smallbusinesscyber/cybersecurity-basics/cybersecurity-risks). Additionally, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) publishes a standard awareness document about the [top 10 most critical security risks](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) to web applications, which is updated regularly.
- To learn more about the vulnerabilities explained in this section of the reading, as well as other vulnerabilities, explore the [NIST National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln) and [CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).
- Cyber Threat Framework (CTF) and the International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001.
- To learn more about controls, particularly those used to protect health-related assets from a variety of threat types, review the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ [Physical Access Control presentation](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/physical-access-control.pdf).
- One way to verify data integrity is through [cryptography](https://www.nist.gov/cryptography#:~:text=Cryptography%20uses%20mathematical%20techniques%20to,that%20drives%20research%20and%20innovation.), which is used to transform data so unauthorized parties cannot read or tamper with it (NIST, 2022).
- In the workplace, security principles are embedded in your daily tasks. Whether you are analyzing logs, monitoring a security information and event management (SIEM) dashboard, or using a [vulnerability scanner](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/vulnerability_scanner), you will use these principles in some way.
- The security of key systems should not rely on keeping details hidden. Consider the following example from OWASP (2016): [OWASP Mobile Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/2016-risks/)
- Resources that you can explore to further develop your understanding of audits in the cybersecurity space are: 
	- [Assessment and Auditing Resources](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/assessment-auditing-resources)  
	- [IT Disaster Recovery Plan](https://www.ready.gov/it-disaster-recovery-plan)

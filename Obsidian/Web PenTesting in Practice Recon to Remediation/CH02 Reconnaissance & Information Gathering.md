	 - Active VS Passive Recon
		O Both methods are considered effective ways to gather information about the target The difference in naming comes from the way the target is interacted with
		during the information gathering process.
		
		O ==Active Reconnaissance:== Directly involves interacting with the target system to
		gather information, For example, sending probes to collect data on vulnerabilities,
		
		O ==Passive Reconnaissance:== Involves gathering information without direct interaction
		with the target, This can include searching through logs, public information,
		or traces without alerting the target,

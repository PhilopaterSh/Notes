     Question 1: Theoretical Foundations
    </span>
</p>
<p class="theory-question">
    What are the core contributions of the Turing Machine and the Von Neumann Model to modern computing?
   </p>
<div class="theory-answer">
<strong>
     Answer:
    </strong>
<br/>
    The Turing Machine established the theoretical model of a universal programmable device that accepts input, processes it via instructions, and produces output. The Von Neumann Model added the practical architecture used today, proposing that both data and programs should be stored in the same Memory. It defined the four main hardware subsystems: Memory, Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Control Unit (CU), and Input/Output.

     Question 2: The CIA Triad
    </span>
</p>
<p class="theory-question">
    Explain the three core objectives of cybersecurity known as the CIA Triad. Provide a brief definition of each component and explain why all three are necessary for comprehensive information security.
   </p>
<div class="theory-answer">
<strong>
     Answer:
    </strong>
<br/>
    The CIA Triad consists of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Confidentiality ensures that private or confidential information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals and that individuals control what information about them is collected and shared. Integrity ensures that information and programs are changed only in authorized ways (data integrity) and that systems perform their intended functions without manipulation (system integrity). Availability ensures that systems work promptly and services are not denied to authorized users. All three are essential because protecting only one or two aspects leaves systems vulnerable to different types of attacks and compromises overall security.

     Question 5: Memory and Storage Differences
    </span>
</p>
<p class="theory-question">
    Briefly distinguish between RAM vs. ROM and Magnetic Hard Drives vs. SSDs.
   </p>
<div class="theory-answer">
<strong>
     Answer:
    </strong>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
       Ram vs. ROM:
      </strong>
      RAM the memory that holds data and program instructions as the CPU works with them. RAM is volatile, meaning it holds data only when the power is on. When the power is off, RAM’s contents are lost. ROM : It is the memory that holds the Basic Input Output System (BIOS) of the computer, which is responsible of testing all the PC hardware as soon as it is turned on.
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       HDD vs. SSD:
      </strong>
      Magnetic Hard Drives (HDD) use moving mechanical parts to read magnetic disks, making them slower. Solid State Drives (SSD) use flash memory with no moving parts, making them significantly faster, more durable, and more efficient.

     Question 6: Passive vs. Active Attacks
    </span>
</p>
<p class="theory-question">
    Differentiate between passive and active security attacks. Provide examples of each type and explain which one is typically more difficult to detect and why.
   </p>
<div class="theory-answer">
<strong>
     Answer:
    </strong>
<br/>
    Passive attacks attempt to learn or make use of information from a system without affecting system resources. Examples include eavesdropping and traffic analysis. These attacks do not modify data or disrupt operations.
    <br/>
    Active attacks attempt to alter system resources or affect their operation. Examples include masquerade (impersonation), replay, modification of messages, and denial of service.
    <br/>
    Passive attacks are typically more difficult to detect because they do not alter data or disrupt operations, leaving no obvious traces. Since the attacker only monitors communication without making changes, the system functions normally, making detection challenging without specialized monitoring tools.

<div class="theory-answer">
<strong>
     Answer:
    </strong>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
       Multitasking:
      </strong>
      The OS rotates rapidly between different programs on a single core to simulate simultaneous execution.
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       Multithreading:
      </strong>
      The OS rotates between different instructions (threads) within the same program to speed up specific tasks.
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       Multiprocessing:
      </strong>
      The OS utilizes multiple cores or CPUs to execute different programs truly simultaneously, rather than sequentially.

     Question 10: Security Breach Scenario (Easy Scenario)
    </span>
</p>
<p class="theory-question">
    Scenario: A hospital discovers that patient medical records were accessed by an unauthorized employee who viewed confidential information but did not modify or delete any data. The employee was properly authenticated to the hospital system but accessed records beyond their authorized scope. Identify which security objective was violated and explain what security service should have prevented this incident.
   </p>
<div class="theory-answer">
<strong>
     Answer:
    </strong>
<br/>
    The primary security objective violated was Confidentiality, specifically Data Confidentiality and Privacy.
    <br/>
    The security service that should have prevented this is Access Control, which controls who can access resources, Proper access control would have restricted the employee to only view records within their scope of work, preventing unauthorized access to other patients.

   </p>
<div class="theory-answer">
<strong>
     Answer:
    </strong>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
       LAN vs. WAN:
      </strong>
      A LAN (Local Area Network) connects computers in a small physical area using cables or Wi-Fi. A WAN (Wide Area Network) connects multiple LANs across large geographical distances using routers and leased lines.
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       Structure:
      </strong>
      In Client/Server networks, a central server manages security and resources while clients share the workload. In Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks, all computers are equal, sharing files and devices directly with one another without a central server.

   </p>
<div class="theory-answer">
<strong>
     Answer:
    </strong>
<br/>
    Keyless algorithms do not use keys and include cryptographic hash functions that create fixed-length digests. Use case: verifying data integrity or creating message authentication codes.
    <br/>
    Single-key (symmetric) algorithms use one secret key shared between parties for both encryption and decryption. Use case: encrypting large amounts of data quickly
    <br/>
    Two-key (asymmetric) algorithms use a private key (kept secret) and public key (shared openly). Use case: secure key exchange, digital signatures, or encrypting

     Question 19: Describe three different mitigation techniques that can protect systems from DoS attacks. For each technique describe it shortly
    </span>
</p>
<div class="theory-answer">
<strong>
     Answer:
    </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
     Traffic routing and filtering:
    </strong>
    routes suspicious traffic to scrubbing centers where rate-limiting and CAPTCHA verification filter out malicious requests while allowing legitimate users through.
    <br/>
<strong>
     Load balancers:
    </strong>
    These distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers, detecting high CPU usage and automatically redirecting connections to underutilized nodes.
    <br/>
<strong>
     Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):
    </strong>
    IDS detects attacks by monitoring for excessive login attempts or packet floods, alerting security teams for response, while IPS actively blocks malicious traffic by dropping packets and temporarily blocking attacker IP ranges automatically.

     Question 24: Compare between ping flood and syn flood attack
    </span>
</p>
<div class="theory-answer">
<strong>
     Answer:
    </strong>
<br/>
    SYN Flood attacks exploit the TCP three-way handshake by sending numerous SYN packets but never completing the connection with the final ACK. This causes the server to keep half-open connections waiting. ICMP Flooding attacks use ping requests (ICMP Echo Request packets) sent in massive quantities to overwhelm the target. The command ping -f sends packets. Both attacks consume bandwidth and CPU resources.

    </span>
</p>
<div class="theory-answer">
<strong>
     Answer:
    </strong>
<br/>
    DNS spoofing or HTTP spoofing works by redirecting victims to fake websites while making them believe they are accessing legitimate servers. The attacker poisons DNS caches or manipulates DNS responses, causing the victim computer to receive incorrect IP addresses for trusted domains.

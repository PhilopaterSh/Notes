<li>C. Delete system files remotely</li>
<li>D. Only access public websites</li>
</ul>
<p>Correct Answer: <span class='correct-answer'>B</span></p>
<p class='reason'>Reason: The core danger of MITM is that the attacker remains invisible while reading, copying, or even changing the data being sent between two legitimate parties.  </p>
</div>
<div class='question-block'>
<p><span class='question-text'>Question 7:</span> Which scenario best describes a planned cyberattack?</p>
<ul class='choices-list'>
<li>A. A random spam email received by millions</li>
<li>B. A coordinated action to achieve a specific goal</li>
<li>C. An accidental server misconfiguration</li>
<li>D. A sudden spike in legitimate website traffic</li>
</ul>
<p>Correct Answer: <span class='correct-answer'>B</span></p>
<p class='reason'>Reason: Unlike random errors or traffic spikes, a planned attack is an intentional, organized effort with a defined target and desired outcome.  </p>
</div>
<div class='question-block'>
<p><span class='question-text'>Question 8:</span> Which type of cyberattack would prevent legitimate users from accessing a service without necessarily stealing data?</p>
<ul class='choices-list'>
<li>A. SQL Injection</li>
<li>B. Denial of Service (DoS)</li>
<li>C. Phishing</li>
<li>D. Digital Vandalism</li>
</ul>
<p>Correct Answer: <span class='correct-answer'>B</span></p>
<p class='reason'>Reason: The primary function of a DoS attack is to crash a system or flood it with traffic so that it becomes unavailable to those who need it.  </p>
</div>
<div class='question-block'>
<p><span class='question-text'>Question 9:</span> An attacker sends input larger than the allocated memory buffer to execute malicious code. This is an example of:</p>
<ul class='choices-list'>
<li>A. ICMP Flood</li>
<li>B. Buffer Overflow</li>
<li>C. SYN Flood</li>
<li>D. Shrew Attack</li>
</ul>
<p>Correct Answer: <span class='correct-answer'>B</span></p>
<p class='reason'>Reason: When a program receives more data than it can hold, the extra data "overflows" into adjacent memory, which attackers use to inject and run their own code.  </p>
</div>
<div class='question-block'>
<p><span class='question-text'>Question 10:</span> The cybersecurity lesson “hackers never sleep” implies that organizations must:</p>
<ul class='choices-list'>
<li>A. Ignore minor vulnerabilities</li>
<li>B. Continuously monitor and update their defenses</li>
<li>C. Rely solely on static firewalls</li>
<li>D. Assume attacks only happen during business hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Correct Answer: <span class='correct-answer'>B</span></p>
<p class='reason'>Reason: Because threats are automated and global, they can occur at any time, requiring around-the-clock monitoring and constant system updates.   </p>
</div>
<div class='question-block'>
<p><span class='question-text'>Question 11:</span> A web server is flooded with thousands of fake requests, making it unavailable to legitimate users. What type of attack is this?</p>
<ul class='choices-list'>
<li>A. SQL Injection</li>
<li>B. Denial of Service (DoS)</li>
<li>C. Phishing</li>
<li>D. Insider threat</li>
</ul>
<p>Correct Answer: <span class='correct-answer'>B</span></p>
<p class='reason'>Reason: Denial of Service is defined by the intentional exhaustion of system resources to block authorized access.  </p>
</div>
<div class='question-block'>
<p><span class='question-text'>Question 12:</span> A network administrator detects repeated ICMP Echo Requests from a single IP. This indicates:</p>
<ul class='choices-list'>
<li>A. SYN Flood</li>
<li>B. ICMP Flood</li>
<li>C. Shrew Attack</li>
<li>D. Buffer Overflow</li>
</ul>
<p>Correct Answer: <span class='correct-answer'>B</span></p>
<p class='reason'>Reason: ICMP Echo Requests are used by "ping"; a flood of these packets is a specific type of DoS attack meant to overwhelm the network interface.  </p>
</div>
<div class='question-block'>
<p><span class='question-text'>Question 13:</span> Which technique helps distribute traffic to prevent a DoS attack from overwhelming a single server?</p>
<ul class='choices-list'>
<li>A. Load balancer</li>
<li>B. Turning off the server</li>
<li>C. Ignoring all traffic</li>
<li>D. Enabling encryption</li>
</ul>
<p>Correct Answer: <span class='correct-answer'>A</span></p>
<p class='reason'>Reason: Load balancers act as traffic cops, distributing incoming requests across several servers so that no single machine becomes a point of failure.  </p>
</div>
<div class='question-block'>
<p><span class='question-text'>Question 14:</span> A DNS server is receiving excessive queries, causing websites to be unreachable. What type of attack is this?</p>
<ul class='choices-list'>
<li>A. Buffer Overflow</li>
<li>B. DNS Server Attack</li>
<li>C. Phishing</li>
<li>D. Shrew Attack</li>
</ul>
<p>Correct Answer: <span class='correct-answer'>B</span></p>
<p class='reason'>Reason: By attacking the DNS server, the attacker prevents the system from translating website names (like https://www.google.com/search?q=google.com) into IP addresses, effectively "hiding" the sites.  </p>
</div>
<div class='question-block'>
<p><span class='question-text'>Question 15:</span> The command “ping -f” is dangerous because it:</p>
<ul class='choices-list'>
<li>A. Sends packets very slowly</li>
<li>B. Floods a target with ICMP packets as fast as possible</li>
<li>C. Tests firewalls only</li>
<li>D. Encrypts packets for security</li>
</ul>
<p>Correct Answer: <span class='correct-answer'>B</span></p>
<p class='reason'>Reason: The "-f" stands for "flood." It sends packets without waiting for a response, which can easily saturate a network or crash a target device.  </p>
</div>
<div class='question-block'>
<p><span class='question-text'>Question 16:</span> Sending oversized ICMP packets to crash an old server is known as:</p>
<ul class='choices-list'>
<li>A. Shrew Attack</li>
<li>B. Ping of Death</li>
<li>C. SYN Flood</li>
<li>D. SQL Injection</li>
</ul>
<p>Correct Answer: <span class='correct-answer'>B</span></p>
<p class='reason'>Reason: Historical systems couldn't handle packets larger than the maximum IP size (65,535 bytes), causing them to crash upon receipt of such malformed data.  </p>
</div>
<div class='question-block'>
<p><span class='question-text'>Question 17:</span> A buffer overflow attack occurs due to:</p>
<ul class='choices-list'>
<li>A. Slow internet speed</li>
<li>B. Unsafe memory handling and poor input validation</li>
<li>C. Firewall misconfiguration</li>
</ul>
<p>Correct Answer: <span class='correct-answer'>B</span></p>
<p class='reason'>Reason: It is a fundamental programming flaw where the software does not check if the incoming data fits within the memory space allocated for it.  </p>
</div>
<div class='question-block'>
<p><span class='question-text'>Question 18:</span> SYN Flood attacks exploit which protocol’s mechanism?</p>
<ul class='choices-list'>
<li>A. TCP three-way handshake</li>
<li>B. ICMP echo response</li>
<li>C. DNS server caching</li>
</ul>
<p>Correct Answer: <span class='correct-answer'>A</span></p>
<p class='reason'>Reason: The attacker sends many "SYN" (synchronize) requests but never sends the final "ACK" (acknowledge), leaving the server waiting and consuming resources until it crashes.  </p>
</div>
<div class='question-block'>
<p><span class='question-text'>Question 19:</span> Shrew Attacks are difficult to detect because they:</p>
<ul class='choices-list'>
<li>A. Send massive amounts of data</li>
<li>B. Mimic normal traffic patterns using low-rate timed bursts</li>
<li>C. Disable the victim’s IDS</li>
</ul>
<p>Correct Answer: <span class='correct-answer'>B</span></p>
<p class='reason'>Reason: Instead of a constant flood, Shrew attacks use short, sharp pulses that exploit TCP retransmission timers, making the traffic look legitimate to most monitors.  </p>
</div>
<div class='question-block'>
<p><span class='question-text'>Question 20:</span> Which attack is mostly historical but still taught to understand network vulnerabilities?</p>
<ul class='choices-list'>
<li>A. Modern ransomware</li>
<li>B. Ping of Death</li>
<li>C. SQL Injection</li>
</ul>
<p>Correct Answer: <span class='correct-answer'>B</span></p>
<p class='reason'>Reason: Modern operating systems are built to handle oversized packets, but the Ping of Death remains a vital lesson in protocol-based vulnerabilities.   </p>

<p><span class='question-text'>Question 1: Theoretical Foundations</span></p>
<p class="theory-question">What are the core contributions of the Turing Machine and the Von Neumann Model to modern computing?</p>
<div class='theory-answer'><strong>Answer:</strong><br>The Turing Machine established the theoretical model of a universal programmable device that accepts input, processes it via instructions, and produces output. The Von Neumann Model added the practical architecture used today, proposing that both data and programs should be stored in the same Memory. It defined the four main hardware subsystems: Memory, Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Control Unit (CU), and Input/Output.</div>

<div class='question-block'>
<p><span class='question-text'>Question 2: Memory and Storage Differences</span></p>
<p class="theory-question">Briefly distinguish between RAM vs. ROM and Magnetic Hard Drives vs. SSDs.</p>
<div class='theory-answer'><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ram vs. ROM:</strong> RAM the memory that holds data and program instructions as the CPU works with them. RAM is volatile, meaning it holds data only when the power is on. When the power is off, RAM’s contents are lost. ROM : It is the memory that holds the Basic Input Output System (BIOS) of the computer, which is responsible of testing all the PC hardware as soon as it is turned on.</li>
<li><strong>HDD vs. SSD:</strong> Magnetic Hard Drives (HDD) use moving mechanical parts to read magnetic disks, making them slower. Solid State Drives (SSD) use flash memory with no moving parts, making them significantly faster, more durable, and more efficient.</li>

<div class='theory-answer'><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multitasking:</strong> The OS rotates rapidly between different programs on a single core to simulate simultaneous execution.</li>
<li><strong>Multithreading:</strong> The OS rotates between different instructions (threads) within the same program to speed up specific tasks.</li>

<p class="theory-question">Explain the three core objectives of cybersecurity known as the CIA Triad. Provide a brief definition of each component and explain why all three are necessary for comprehensive information security.</p>
<div class='theory-answer'><strong>Answer:</strong><br>The CIA Triad consists of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Confidentiality ensures that private or confidential information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals and that individuals control what information about them is collected and shared. Integrity ensures that information and programs are changed only in authorized ways (data integrity) and that systems perform their intended functions without manipulation (system integrity). Availability ensures that systems work promptly and services are not denied to authorized users. All three are essential because protecting only one or two aspects leaves systems vulnerable to different types of attacks and compromises overall security.</div>
</div>
<div class='question-block'>
<p><span class='question-text'>Question 2: Passive vs. Active Attacks</span></p>
<p class="theory-question">Differentiate between passive and active security attacks. Provide examples of each type and explain which one is typically more difficult to detect and why.</p>
<div class='theory-answer'><strong>Answer:</strong><br>Passive attacks attempt to learn or make use of information from a system without affecting system resources. Examples include eavesdropping and traffic analysis. These attacks do not modify data or disrupt operations.<br>Active attacks attempt to alter system resources or affect their operation. Examples include masquerade (impersonation), replay, modification of messages, and denial of service.<br>Passive attacks are typically more difficult to detect because they do not alter data or disrupt operations, leaving no obvious traces. Since the attacker only monitors communication without making changes, the system functions normally, making detection challenging without specialized monitoring tools.</div>

The employee was properly authenticated to the hospital system but accessed records beyond their authorized scope. Identify which security objective was violated and explain what security service should have prevented this incident.</p>
<div class='theory-answer'><strong>Answer:</strong><br>The primary security objective violated was Confidentiality, specifically Data Confidentiality and Privacy.<br>The security service that should have prevented this is Access Control, which controls who can access resources, Proper access control would have restricted the employee to only view records within their scope of work, preventing unauthorized access to other patients.</div>

<p><span class='question-text'>Question 3: Explain what a Denial of Service (DoS) attack is and describe its primary impact on targeted systems</span></p>
<div class='theory-answer'><strong>Answer:</strong><br>A Denial of Service (DoS) attack targets servers or online services by overwhelming them with automated requests, making them slow, unstable, or completely unavailable to allowed users. primary impact is service disruption; legitimate users cannot access websites or applications, potentially causing business losses and reputation damage.</div>
</div>
<div class='question-block'>
<p><span class='question-text'>Question 4: List at least two symptoms that indicate a system might be under a DoS attack.</span></p>
<div class='theory-answer'><strong>Answer:</strong><br>(1) inability to access a website or service<br>(2) extremely slow response times or delays in loading content<br>(3) increased spam emails combined with overall poor system performance.</div>
</div>
<div class='question-block'>
<p><span class='question-text'>Question 5: Describe three different mitigation techniques that can protect systems from DoS attacks. For each technique describe it shortly</span></p>
<div class='theory-answer'><strong>Answer:</strong><br><strong>Traffic routing and filtering:</strong> routes suspicious traffic to scrubbing centers where rate-limiting and CAPTCHA verification filter out malicious requests while allowing legitimate users through.<br><strong>Load balancers:</strong> These distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers, detecting high CPU usage and automatically redirecting connections to underutilized nodes.<br><strong>Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):</strong> IDS detects attacks by monitoring for excessive login attempts or packet floods, alerting security teams for response, while IPS actively blocks malicious traffic by dropping packets and temporarily blocking attacker IP ranges automatically.</div>
</div>
<div class='question-block'>
<p><span class='question-text'>Question 6: List 5 Types of DoS Attacks</span></p>
<div class='theory-answer'><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
<ol>
<li>DNS server attacks</li>
<li>http server attacks</li>
<li>icmp flooding</li>
<li>Buffer over flow attack</li>
<li>Large file download attack</li>
<li>Syn flood attack</li>
<li>Ping of death attack</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class='question-block'>
<p><span class='question-text'>Question 7: Compare between ping flood and syn flood attack</span></p>
<div class='theory-answer'><strong>Answer:</strong><br>SYN Flood attacks exploit the TCP three-way handshake by sending numerous SYN packets but never completing the connection with the final ACK. This causes the server to keep half-open connections waiting. ICMP Flooding attacks use ping requests (ICMP Echo Request packets) sent in massive quantities to overwhelm the target. The command ping -f sends packets. Both attacks consume bandwidth and CPU resources.</div>
